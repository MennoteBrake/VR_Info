# VR Info

## Project description
This is a mobile app for Android and iOS where you can plan your journey with the trains of [VR.fi](https://www.vr.fi/en).

This app uses real-time data provided by Finland's railway network operators. Using that data, the app provides the user with a map of all active trains, their schedule and route.
It also provides useful information such as planned maintenance works and upcoming departures from any given station.
